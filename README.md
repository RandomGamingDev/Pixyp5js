# Pixyp5js
Pixy (Credit to Nyaaborn for the name, you can find his github here: https://github.com/Nyaaboron) from Wireframe, but for p5js

Pixyp5js is a version of [Pixy](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Wireframe/blob/main/Extensions/Pixy.h) (which is for the [Wireframe](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Wireframe)), but for p5js!

To use the library simply create a new instance of the pixy class with the offset, size and resolution (they're all arrays with 2 elements) and then just change the Pixy.pixels array and execute Pixy.display() in order to display!

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/Pixyp5js/pixy.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
