# Pixyp5js
Pixy from Wireframe, but for p5js

Pixyp5js is a version of [Pixy](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Wireframe/blob/main/Extensions/Pixy.h) (which is for the [Wireframe](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/Wireframe)), but for p5js!

To use the library simply create a new instance of the pixy class with the offset, size and resolution (they're all arrays with 2 elements) and then just change the Pixy.pixels array and execute Pixy.display() in order to display!
